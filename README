This is a Django web application that is capable of keeping track of RuneScape commodity prices and deciding which ones are potentially profitable to invest in. Autotrader has two main parts: a backend that runs in the background, and a web frontend that displays the analysis. Autotrader merely analyzes the shapes of the graphs and the volume of the trades. It does not take into account any news.
